## Troubleshooting:

1. Python troubleshooting: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
2. (Ubuntu) - Can not compile mod files with nrnivmodl, get "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lncurses"
  Solution: 
    you need to install ncurses development, in ubuntu this is how to install it:
                              sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
          
## installation using virtual environment
If you prefer to create a python virtual environment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), you can create one by 

python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

Replace /path/to/new/virtual/environment with the folder you want. Activate the venv by 

source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate 

Then do 
pip3 install neuron
